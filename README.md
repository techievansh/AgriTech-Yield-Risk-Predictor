# AgriTech-Yield-Risk-Predictor
Agri-Tech is an AI-powered platform that predicts crop yield, assesses farming risks, and creates a Digital Twin of farmland for simulation and analysis. Using weather, soil, and crop data, it provides predictive insights and smart farming recommendations to support data-driven decisions and improve agricultural productivity and sustainability.
🌾 Agri-Tech: Precision Crop Yield & Risk Predictor with Digital Twin
📌 Project Overview

Agri-Tech is an AI-driven decision support system designed to enhance agricultural productivity through crop yield forecasting, risk assessment, and Digital Twin-based farm simulation. The platform integrates weather parameters, soil characteristics, and historical crop data to generate predictive insights, risk alerts, and actionable recommendations via an interactive analytical dashboard.

🎯 Problem Statement

Modern agriculture faces multiple uncertainties that impact crop productivity, including:
Climate variability and extreme weather conditions
Soil degradation and nutrient imbalance
Increased probability of crop failure
Lack of predictive, data-driven farming tools
The proposed system addresses these challenges by delivering AI-powered yield prediction, agricultural risk modeling, and digital farm visualization to support informed decision-making.
